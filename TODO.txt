Reminders

    !IMPORTANT! Memory Leak
        All observers need to un-subscribe when they are no longer going to be used, or else
        they are kept in memory because the Observable keeps them in memory.

    Deep copying game state
        GameManager - Copy the game state to be manipulated separately
        copy method to Phases and Steps

    GameManager
        Add a heuristic for evaluating board state

    CastSpellAction::execute
        Check to make sure we are using the correct mana to cast spells

    Create:
        DeckDeserializer (Mostly to ensure the commander isn't included in the deck list)

    Move the appraiseHandDraw method and use the game heuristic to evaluate the hand
    Have the GameEventHandler notify all observers of actions taken

    Integration tests
        DeckAppraiser::appraiseHandDraw (will probably move this method)

        simulator.gameManager package
