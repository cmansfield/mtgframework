Mtg Framework TODO list

Other
    Add additional exception handling in main
    Replace System.out.prints with logging
    Add more program args

DeckValidator::isFormatCompliant
    Make sure all formats other than commander are validated correctly

GameManager
    Use the command pattern to add actions to the stack
    Use the observer pattern to notify listeners when something is placed
        on the stack and at what time

CastSpellAction::execute
    Check to make sure we are using the correct mana to cast spells

Create:
    card type constants (Maybe not. if I do I would have to update this program with each new set)
    DeckDeserializer (Mostly to ensure the commander isn't included in the deck list)

LoadCards::LookupCard
    Allow lookup on ascii card names, convert uni-char to ascii for lookup

Testing
    Add integration tests
        DeckValidator::isFormatCompliant (Check other formats)
        DeckAppraiser::appraiseHandDraw (Wait to create this)
        simulator.gameManager package
        simulator.action package
        simulator.turn package
        LoadCards::LookupCard
