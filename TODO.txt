Mtg Framework TODO list

GameManager
    Add a heuristic for evaluating board state
    Copy the game state to be manipulated separately

CastSpellAction::execute
    Check to make sure we are using the correct mana to cast spells

Create:
    card type constants (Maybe not. if I do I would have to update this program with each new set)
    DeckDeserializer (Mostly to ensure the commander isn't included in the deck list)

Add a copy method to Phases and Steps
Fix the issue where when a player is removed from the game, the next player finishes that players
    phases and then it switches to the next player's turn. This is because the phases/steps aren't
    notified when a player is removed from the game.

Testing
    Add integration tests
