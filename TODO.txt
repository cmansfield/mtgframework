    !IMPORTANT! Memory Leak
        All observers need to un-subscribe when they are no longer going to be used, or else
        they are kept in memory because the Observable keeps them in memory.

    Things Waiting on ANTLR grammar for card text
        CastSpellAction::execute
            Check to make sure we are using the correct mana to cast spells
        GameManager
                Add a heuristic for evaluating board state
                When looking ahead to make a better AI, ensure none of the following happens
                    Opponets playing cards (land, and non-land)
                    Viewing library, except for tutoring
                    Viewing Opponent's hand

    Create:
        DeckDeserializer (Mostly to ensure the commander isn't included in the deck list)

    Other:
        Move the appraiseHandDraw method and use the game heuristic to evaluate the hand
        Make it so the Action classes only act on a single card, not a group of cards
        Move logic from step classes in the turn package into new Action classes

    Integration tests
        DeckAppraiser::appraiseHandDraw (will probably move this method)

        simulator.gameManager package
