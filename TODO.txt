Mtg Framework TODO list

GameManager
    Use the command pattern to add actions to the stack
    Use the observer pattern to notify listeners when something is placed
        on the stack and at what time

CastSpellAction::execute
    Check to make sure we are using the correct mana to cast spells

Create:
    card type constants (Maybe not. if I do I would have to update this program with each new set)
    DeckDeserializer (Mostly to ensure the commander isn't included in the deck list)

Sonar:
    Return an empty collection rather than null from classes
        Ensure we are not storing empty collections when we save json files
    Replace System.out.prints with logging

Testing
    Add integration tests
        DeckAppraiser::appraiseHandDraw (Wait to create this)
        simulator.gameManager package
        simulator.action package
        simulator.turn package
        LoadCards::LookupCard
