GameManager
    Add a heuristic for evaluating board state

CastSpellAction::execute
    Check to make sure we are using the correct mana to cast spells

Create:
    DeckDeserializer (Mostly to ensure the commander isn't included in the deck list)

Move the appraiseHandDraw method and use the game heuristic to evaluate the hand
Have the GameEventHandler notify all observers of actions taken

Testing
    Add integration tests
        DeckAppraiser::appraiseHandDraw (will probably move this method)
