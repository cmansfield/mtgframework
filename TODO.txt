GameManager
    Add a heuristic for evaluating board state
    Copy the game state to be manipulated separately

CastSpellAction::execute

Create:
    DeckDeserializer (Mostly to ensure the commander isn't included in the deck list)
    Copy Constructors
        GameEvent
        GameEventHandler
        Game
        GameManager
    copy method to Phases and Steps

Move the appraiseHandDraw method and use the game heuristic to evaluate the hand
Have the GameEventHandler notify all observers of actions taken

        simulator.turn package
        simulator.gameManager package

        Copy constructors
